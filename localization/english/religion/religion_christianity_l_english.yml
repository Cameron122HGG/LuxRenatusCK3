 catholic_desc: "Catholicism is a Christian Mainstream religion of Clerical soul. Catholics worship the prophet Jesus of Nazareth who sacrificed himself to redeem humankind from its sins, under the interpretation of the Church established by his follower Peter. Jesus Christ is believed to be of both divine and humane nature, son of God, Maria and the Holy Spirit. The Church has a very complex clergy system, headed by a single person known as the Pope. Under the Pope is the College of Cardinals, which consists of priests and other clergy appointed by the Pope. The Pope is elected from amongst the College of Cardinals when the former Pope dies. Catholicism consists of many tenets of faith, including purgatory, Christian sacraments, and the Pope's position as the divine spokesman for God on Earth. Rulers and clergy often butt heads over power, sometimes resulting in wars between the Papacy and other Christian realms."

 cathar_desc: "Catharism is Heretical Christian movement of Populist soul, with strong Gnostic influences. It developed in response to growing corruption in the Catholic Church. It has a strong influence from Manichaeism and early gnostic religions, and maintains close connections with the similar Bogomilist movement in the east. The Cathars are a direct challenge to the Catholic Church, renouncing Catholic practices and dismissing it outright as the Church of Satan. Rather than traditional sacraments, Catharism has only one sacrament: the Consolamentum, in which a brief ceremony is performed to remove all sin from the believer, or credentus, thus making them a perfectus. This sacrament must only be performed once, but perfecti must maintain a strong obligation of purity (and thus, many Cathars perform the Consolamentum on their deathbed). Purity in this life is attained through asceticism and strict moral rules. Sexual actions, even when sanctified by marriage, are abhorred on the grounds that the material world - including the flesh - is intrinsically evil, and thus Cathars largely reject the concept of marriage.  The Cathar society and church have a relatively flat structure, organized around bishops sharing the ascetic principles of their fellow believers and promoting the share of goods."

The principal belief, shared with all other Christian creeds, is that prophet Jesus of Nazareth, living in the 1st century CE, was the son of God who died on the cross and was resurrected to redeem the whole of humanity and deliver it from sin. Still, continous theological disputes fuelled by political divergences - about the nature of the Trinity and the Holy Spirit or organisation of the Church - have resulted in gradual splintering. The Pope Benedict VIII's preaching of a crusade against the Eastern Empire has resulted in the Great Schism of 1019 CE, when high Christian officials decided to support their Emperor rather than follow the Pope's call to revolt. This move has resulted in Orthodoxy severing all ties with the Roman Catholicism, an unprecedented division. The Eastern Roman Empire, although generally hostile to Christians, took the pragmatic step to support the institutionalization of the Orthodox Partiarchate in Orchid in order to limit the subversive influence of Rome's spiritual leadership over its own Christian population. Compared to Roman Catholicism, Orthodoxy has a much more sophisticated cult of sacred images ('icons'), a strong monastic movement with emphasis put on ascetic practices and a very decentralised internal organisation. While Roman Catholics follow the pope's authority, each Orthodox community has an autonomus patriarch, with the ecumenical patriarch considered to be first among the equals. Not having a strong independant church organisation, Orthodox patriarchs tend to rely on local rulers for material backing, and generally develop mutual legitimation relationships with relevant political authorities."

 nestorian: "Nestorianism"

 nestorian_adherent: "Nestorian"
 nestorian_adherent_plural: "Nestorians"
 nestorian_desc: "Nestorianism is a Mainstream Christian religion of Messianic soul, with strong Persian influences. It originates from the theological School of Antioch, which based its Christology on the human Jesus of the Gospels and sought to explain how this man had become united with the eternal Word in the Incarnation. Nestorius, the bishop of Constantinople in the 5th Century CE, emphasized the disunion between the human and divine natures of Jesus. The Church rejected these teachings and exiled him. Fleeing both the Church and the Eastern Emperor Imperator Alexandros X's persecutions against all sorts of Christians - heretical or not - Nestorius and his supporters relocated to Sassanid Persia. They affiliated with the local Christian community, which became increasingly Nestorian in doctrine. Persian scholars expanded on the teachings of Nestorius and his mentors, particularly after the relocation of the School of Edessa, a theological school of great importance to the Syriac speaking world, to the Persian city of Nisibis in 489 CE. Throughout the 6th Century, the church was frequently beset with internal strife and persecution from the Zoroastrians, and even experienced a schism it could hardly overcome. Eventually, the church emerged stronger after this period of ordeal, and increased missionary efforts in spite of complex relationships with the Persian rulers. Indeed, the Sassanid dynasty has developed a patronizing attitude to the Nestorians, seeing them as "good Christians" out of the realm of Lie, if yet not fully enlightened - a pragmatic doctrine which they used to gain support from their own Nestorian minority and impose Nestorianism as the leading Christian church, under strong control by the State. With the weakening of the Sassanid dynasty, the Nestorian church is now free from any form of State control. Nestorian clerics are convinced that a new golden age has arrived, and the Church has entered the 11th Century full of ambition and ready to unite the peoples of the East under the sign of the Cross."

Consequently, humanity is not doomed to sin, but instead chooses to sin of its own free will. Therefore, the “original sin” did not taint humanity and mankind is capable of choosing right and wrong without need of divine aid. This belief directly opposes that of the Catholic Church, which claims that man is inherently evil and that man cannot come to God without the grace of God, symbolized by the Baptism. The Pelagian believers have their own well-structured clergy and are deeply convinced of the heretical nature of mainstream Catholicism."

 adoptionist: "Adoptionism"
 adoptionist_adj: "Adoptionist"
 adoptionist_adherent: "Adoptionists"
 adoptionist_adherent_plural: "Adoptionists"
 adoptionist_desc: "Adoptionism is a Christian Local sect of Clerical soul, the remain of a once popular vision of Jesus Christ among newly-converted Jews in the Levant in the first century after the Encarnation of Christ. They believed that Jesus was the promised Messiah as it was foretold: a Prophet descendant of the Kings of Israel, nothing more, nothing less; therefore, they rejected the divinity of Christ and his immaculate birth of the Virgin Mary, and considered such traditions as later additions and severe deviations from the Truth, very close to infraction of the First Commandment: 'I am God your Lord, thou shalt worship no other god but me'. This blend of Jewish orthodoxy and primordial Christianity was channeled through the Ebionites, the 'Poor Ones', who declared Paul of Tarsus an apostate. In time, Theodotus of Byzantium proclaimed in the IInd Century that Jesus was a man entirely until God, because of his sinlessness and immaculate spirit, adopted him in order to make him Christ. This idea, an easy solution to the problem of monotheism in a religion with two main divinities (God and Christ) that are meant to be one and the same, kept reappearing in several places despite condemnation by all the Ecumenical Councils until it sprang with renewed force in Hispania in the VIIth Century, when the Archbishop of Toledo, Elipandus, and the Bishop of Urgell, Felix, propagated the view that the phrase 'Son of God' was metaphorical, and that Christ was 'adopted' by God after his baptism. At that moment, the human will of Christ became subservient to his new divine will. This christology was first adopted by a realm in Toledo after the great nobles assassinated their Catholic King Leogivild, who tried hard to convert them to catholicism. In the great Toledo council of 595, in the midst of anarchy, Hispania's nobles found a compromise solution between their various spiritual claims and to avoid entering in either Rome or Carthage's spheres of influence: they elected Leogivild's younger son Reccared, an Adoptionnist, with the Arian Euricing King of Leon famously proclaiming: 'So called Catholic Monarchs have no place in Hispania.' Adoptionism represented the least threatening of all faiths for the nobles' autonomy. Elipandus of Toledo, archbishop of Toledo (717-808) further codified Adoptionism by teaching that Christ's human nature existed separately from His divine personhood. The condemnation of this doctrine in the Council of Ratisbon in 792 only served to strengthen its hold on the Celtiberian highlands, where nobles remain jealous of their autonomy from distant Pope and Emperors."

 antinomian_adherent_plural: "Antinomians"
 antinomian_desc: "Antinomianism is a Christian Heretical sect of Populist soul, with a strong Barbarian ascendant. It emerged in the 1st Century as a result of theological criticisms over the strict morale rules contained in the Old Covenant. According to some, moral law was of no use or obligation under the gospel dispensation of grace because faith alone was necessary to salvation. Under this theological guidance, some early Christian communities in Jerusalem are said to have practiced anarchist communism, sharing money, labor and women equally and fairly among the members, refusing any set of rules that they considered arbitrary. These early experiments, remembered by marginalized priests exiled to the fringes of Christianity, spurred a renewal among superficially-Christianized Goths when imperial authority weakened. In the ensuing chaos, new ambitious leaders looking for a mobilizing ideology met the radical preachers of the Antinomian revolution. The new Antinomian rulers claimed that Jesus' love, which is limitless, would wash away the sinful laws and hierarchies set up by the former Roman elite. Antinomianism is now a political and economic program as much as a religion, whereby believers combine Gothic tribal rituals with a new emphasis on moral nihilism, sexual freedom, and absolute collectivism."

Apollinaris theorized that Jesus could not have had a human mind, but rather he had a human body and a divine mind. This went against the traditional view that Jesus had both a human body and a human mind as culminated by his presence as the Son of God made flesh. Since by Church decree Christ was both fully human and fully God, Apollinaris and his followers were accused of attempting to create a 'tertium quid' ('third thing,' neither God nor man). Apollinarism was declared to be a heresy in 381 CE by the First Council of Constantinople.

The movement developed in Euskalia as a local synthesis between Arianism and more ancient local beliefs. Believers follow many Christian beliefs and practices but put a heavy emphasis on the veneration of Mari (also equated with the Virgin Mary). Each village or community follows the spiritual directions of a virgin crone, often a kind of village elder, whose religious influence supercedes that of the standard Christian clergy. Traditionally, it is only the virgin crones who have the authority to select and give sacraments to Euskalist priests."

Pelagianism opposes mainstrean Catholicism by stating that mankind is capable of choosing right and wrong without need of divine aid, while Catholicism teaches that man cannot come to God without the grace of God. The Semipelagian compromise states that beginning of faith is free will, but the growth of faith is God's work. This is contrary to the common Catholic belief at the time that the beginning of faith requires an initiative from God, but the rest is free will. Thus, according to Catholicism, no one can merit the initial grace of forgiveness associated with conversion, as Semipelagians attempt to convey. In practice, Semipelagian communities have their own well-structured clergy and their rites have evolved in a distinct way, although they are not as radical as Pelagians in opposing mainstream Catholicism."

Increasing influence of the Solar religions among Slavic peoples motivated the Catholic Church to pay due attention to this group of people emerging as the power broker of the distant eastern lands. The Pope sent twelve clerical envoys with a strong escort and lavish gifts to make their way to the eastern edge of the world for the sake of meeting, impressing, and converting the king of the Slavs. For three years, no news came to Rome from the Papal embassy. Eventually, an Audianist merchant from Caffa brought one of the chests back with the heads of eleven of the envoys. No more was heard from the Slavs for twenty-nine years, until a delegation came presenting themselves as envoys of the Bishop of the Holy Church of the Slavs. How the last of the twelve envoys could succeed is not clear, but a semiautonomous Christian church for the Slavs emerged. It first organized itself underground, without support from any ruler or the rest of Christendom. As a result, the Slavic clerics have started creating am organized clergy of their own, somwhow replicating the early Christian days when the Church had to hide from the Roman State."

solomonic_christ_desc: "Solomonic Christianity is a Local Christian sect of Statist soul, with significant Archaic influences. The Ethiopian Church, although Christian, evolved under the prophetic rule of the Solomonid dynasty. It retains a stronger emphasis on the Old Testament and even integrates some elements from the Arabo-Sabaean religions, where ancient gods are merged with Biblical Prophets. Solomon is specially commemorated as a prophet almost the equal of the Christ, with the title of 'Righteous Prophet and King'. King Solomon seduced the Queen of Saba, herself descendant of Almaqah, the Sabaean sun god, and sired her son, Menelik I. He became the first Emperor of Ethiopia and brought the Ark of the Covenant, with divine assistance, to Ethiopia. The Solomonid dynasty, claiming descent from Solomon and the Queen of Sheba through Menelik I, thus perpetuates the rule of the House of David. Solomonic Christians believe the Solomonid dynasty and their state to be of divine nature, and see themselves as God's chosen people - the only legitimate perpetrators of the Alliance of the Old Testament."

unctionist_desc: "Unctionism is Local Christian religion of Statist soul. The Merovingian kings of Francia elevated the sanctity of kingship to the point where the king and a council of the bishops of the realm supplant the role of the Pope. This royal supremacy is symbolized during coronation. Like with the kings of the Old Testament, the coronation ceremony is the covenant between God and the Capetian sovereign: in exchange for divine unction by holy oil, the king promises to reign with justice, to protect his people, and to uphold the faith. This alliance took tangible form with the Sainte Ampoule, or Holy Flask. The Sainte Ampoule was brought to Saint Remi by a dove sent by God for the baptism of Clovis I, the first Frankish king to convert to Christianity. It gets miraculously refilled by God every time for each coronation of a true king, demonstrating the direct relation between God and the Frankish royal line."
