 classical_government_desc: "\n$game_concept_classical_desc$\n\n#F The classical Roman and Hellenistic form of government emphasizes enlightened rule by the monarch. In the classical Greco-Roman political model the ruler is less involved in the day to day decision making, hampering centralization limiting personal domain. At the same time, the realm's administration is more developed and maintains the Greco-Roman legal system, preventing realm split upon succession. Prestigious rulers develop thier urban centers. On the battlefield, Greco-Roman Pikemen and heavy infantry remain unmatched, heirs to the phalanx and the legion. #!"
