 bm_1066_britain:0 "The Ruin of Britain"
 bm_1066_britain_desc:2 "Britain cannot be said to be a place of peace. Long ago abandoned by Rome, the successors of Artorius, Hereditary Governor of Britannia fight amongst themselves. To the south anglo-saxon mercenaries become warlords, to the north viking raiders style themselves as kings. In all of this chaos some native celts dare to dream of an Albion from before even the Caesars. But deep down every player on the board knows, whether the title be High King of the Britons, Brytenwalda of the Saxons, or Imperator of the Romans, in the end there can be one master of this island!#!"

 bookmark_britain_anglia:0 "King Svend of Anglia"
 bookmark_britain_anglia_desc:2 "Less than a century ago, Sweyn carved a kingdom in Britain, his son Knut carved a Nordic empire from the Baltic to Iceland. These short-lived states have since then disintegrated in a great civil war. Their offspring, Sven, barely rules over the Norse enclave of Lundinium in the middle of the vast Saxon heartland. His ancestors' majesty has passed to him, though, and Sven appears to many as the true Light of Sunna, the Norse Sun Goddess. Miklariki, the Empire of the North, awaits its beacon!#!"


 bookmark_britain_norway:0 "Harald Hardrade"
 bookmark_britain_norway_desc:1 "Having displayed formidable military talent since youth, Harald has recently tried, and failed, to conquer Denmark. Now, he looks beyond the sea — by ancient contract, the crown of England should have passed to Harald, when the last King died without an heir. But, instead, the Anglo-Saxons have put Harold Godwinson on the throne! Luckily, the false King has made enemies, and Tostig Godwinson, Harold's own brother, lives in exile in Norway...\n\n#bold By using his own enemies against him, can you give this Varangian viking control over the North Sea?#!"

 bookmark_britain_denmark:0 "King Svend of Denmark"
 bookmark_britain_denmark_desc:1 "With blood ties to England and Norway, Svend has strong claims to both thrones. Unfortunately, his armies are small and undisciplined, making a war of conquest unfeasible. However, there are other ways to pursue one's dreams...\n\n#bold If your children were to be married into powerful families, it could grant many useful alliances — alliances you could leverage to found an empire that would rival Rome itself!#!"

 bookmark_britain_scotland_desc:1 "Known to Scotland as the "Great Chief", Malcolm III's situation is tenuous, but full of opportunity. To the south, the rich lands of Northumbria lie vulnerable as England is torn apart by war, but Norse warlords and Gaelic highlanders yet contest the king's rule at home.\n\n#bold The British Isles teem with dangers and opportunities: can you pluck a rose from this garden of thorns?#!"
